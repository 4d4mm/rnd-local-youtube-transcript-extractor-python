# rnd-local-youtube-transcript-extractor-python

This project leverages Selenium automation to extract YouTube video transcripts and save them as Markdown files. The ultimate goal is to enable an AI to analyze these transcripts and recommend which videos are worth watching based on a given search topic. It's an experimental approach to streamline content curation and automation!

**⚠️ WARNING:**  
This project is intended solely for personal use to improve my local workflow. It is *not* designed for production environments. If you're looking for a production-ready solution for transcript extraction, consider using the official [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) instead.
